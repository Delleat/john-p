Haiii :333

As you probably already noticed this lil silly project is made just for fun and nothing in here is professional. :3
Every script sucks, every texture, sound, sprite, everything sucks :3

Oh and if you want to open it somewhere else than on linux... well good luck.
Sowwy I have a bit more serious problems with this thing than making it work on windows >~<
Maybe someday ;3

Oh yeah and if you are on linux and want to open this abbomination you'll have to go to this directory 'john-p/rust/target/debug/' and extract that one zip file there and leave that one .so file in this directory and it should work nicely :3
Or alternatively you could get rid of that zip file and just go to rust directory and compile that library... if you have cargo of course.
It'll take a while and a lot of space because somehow that godot-rust crate is MASSIVE >~<

Anyways, Have fun xd
